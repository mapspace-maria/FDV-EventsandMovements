# FDV-EventsandMovements

I'VE CREATE THE TWO MAIN SCRIPTS FOR THIS GAME

THE PLAYER CONTROLLER: WILL ALLOW THE PLAYER TO MOVE CROSS PLANE IN THE X,Z AXIS USING THE ARROW 

THE ENEMY CONTROLLER: WILL CHASE THE PLAYER. FIRST APPROCHING IT FROM FAR AWAY AND FOLLOWING ANY MOVEMENT THE PLAYER DOES. 


LATER I'VE CREATED THE POINTS, SCOORINGBOARD AND THE FUNCTION TO TELEPORT

THE POINTS: THESE ARE SMALL CAPSULES ACROSS THE PLANE WHICH THE PLAYER HAS TO EAT. THERE ARE A COLLOSION AND DESTROY FUNCTION TO DETECT THE COLLISION AND TO MAKE IT DESAPPEAR (HAS BEEN EATEN)

THE SCORING BOARD: IT WILL SHOW THE POINTS DURING THE GAME - IT WILL GO UP EVERYTIME THE PLAYER EATS A CAPSULE

THE TELEPORTWALL: THIS BEHAVIOR WAS ADDED TO DAFE THE PLAYER FROM THE SPHERE. IF THE PLAYER TOUCH(COLLIDE) THE RED WALL, IT WILL BE TELEPORTED TO THE RED CILINDER BEHIND THE WALL. THEY SPHERE WONT BE ABLE TO CATCH IT.
